# Fun with Microservices

I went online and refreshed myself on web dev, because I spent the better part of the last 4.5 years working in the autonomous vehicles/robotics space. Majority of my days was spent coding in C++ and python for all the ML related tasks.

This repo is the effort of going through three weeks of educational content. A mostly operational example of a system that is an event based, microservice style system that handles a ticketing purchase app. I love the internet! You can learn whatever you want!
